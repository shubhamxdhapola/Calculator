# Calculator

This project is a **responsive calculator web application** that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean UI, dark and light theme switching, and validates user input to prevent invalid expressions. The calculator is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Theme Switch**: Toggle between dark and light mode for a personalized experience.
- **Real-Time Input Validation**: Ensures correct calculations by validating the input in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Backspace & Clear**: Easily correct input mistakes with the backspace button and clear the entire display with the "C" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To create the structure and elements of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design, including theme switching.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core logic for calculations, input validation, and theme switching.

## How It Works

1. **Input Handling**: Users can input numbers and operators using the on-screen buttons. The input is validated in real-time to ensure no invalid expressions (e.g., multiple operators in a row).
2. **Calculation**: The expression is evaluated when the equal (`=`) button is pressed, and the result is displayed immediately.
3. **Theme Switching**: Toggle between dark and light themes by clicking the theme switch button at the top of the calculator.
